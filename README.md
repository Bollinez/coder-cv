# coder-cv

## Overview

Not only because it is fun, but also because I prefer a self-made design instead of using Microsoft Word (it never does what you want it to do), I created my CV using Frontend languages. In the course of my current job search and my plan to move from Risk to Tech, I will publish further projects going further.

## Project

As a next step I plan to create an app that enables everyone to create a customized CV. Currently, I target Angular for this project, but I did not finish my researches yet.

I hope you like this first impression!
